# About Project

   
   In our country India we say that we are the largest democracy of the world but I think this thins is followed only when the elections are taking place. Once the goverment is chosen no matter what they do people can't do anything to dethrone them. So Our Project is about Using the power of Democracy for each and every people of the country. So What we are trying to do is maintain a direct web-based relation between the goverment and people , so that the people have a say in the political democracy of India even after the elections by raising their voice to the goverment. Basically , We have developed a system that can do mainly these things:-
    
    1. The people could contact the goverment via a portal called "Query-Posting" that means they can do the following things:-
    
    -- If they have got any problem in their area related to crime, sewage etc that the goverment in that location is not doing they can contact the goverment by posting their query to the site.
    
    -- If they have any suggestions, anything that they want that if it implemented then it would benefit our country they can post this thing so that goverment can hear that.
    
    -- Also, there is Admin sitting on the opposite side , so when you send the request / post about anything they see that things they give you the feedback about your query (that they can do this thing or not).
        
    -- If they found your idea/problem of suggestion unique/genuine then they implement forward it to the corresponding authority and give your the reply.
   
   
   2. The Government could contact the people directly by posting their taken decisions or any decisions they want to take.They have the following functions:-
   -- They can get the feedback from the people on that issue in form of comments and upvotes /downvotes
   
   -- If they are going to take any decision then they can post that decision on the site so that the government cound get the feedback form the people that they are happy or not on that issue.
   
   -- Also the decision is being taken or have been taken they also people can have a say on that issue if they are satisfied on that issue or not . So that the goverment takes action according to that.
   
   
   3. As a Admin people have the following functions:-
   
   -- They can respond to the Query/Suggestions posted by the people
   
   -- If they found it genuine they forward it to the concerned authority
   
   -- Can ban the user if they are abusive/reported
   
   -- Can add/remove the other persons as a Admin
    
    
    4. Also people can respond to the goverment-Posts in form of comments and upvotes/downVote.
